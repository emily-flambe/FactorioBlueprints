# v1.1

Current as of: **June 10, 2024**

- Missing stone/steel â€“ Attach 4 stone furnace steel lanes and a half length stone brick lane (with buffering) to end of red/green mega mall.  Then do steel furnaces by combining the steel and stone brick.  

- Replace some gear production with pipes.

- Insufficient coal flow through to the alternative steel production in mega mall; patched with filter inserters, but maybe it's supposed to be patched by coal in chests.

- Purple build should take a steel/stone lane (for elec furnace, but already made in mega mall for steel furnaces), a half red lane (for elec furnace). a second steel lane (for rails), and boxed prod1.

## Notes from run on 6/10/2024

- Final time: [3:46:04](https://clips.twitch.tv/CloudyBloodyCheesecakeCmonBruh-yDdfJ8uwCZ8NyNUk)
- First time we've launched a rocket in a single session.
- New blueprints are much easier to build
- People are very confused by blueprints where you're not supposed to build some of it (same issue with the satellite part of the 30spm white science build)
- Blueprints were way too large for the number of people we have, and vastly overproduce some things, e.g. ~20k belts and GC in chests at the end of the run.
- We're still not good at having enough base resources (power, ore/plates) -- the 30spm blueprints are designed to work well in those circumstances. The 1h30 MP blueprints fall over hard when there are insufficient resources.

Current as of June 10, 2024

# Known Issues v1.1

- Missing stone/steel â€“ Attach 4 stone furnace steel lanes and a half length stone brick lane (with buffering) to end of red/green mega mall.  Then do steel furnaces by combining the steel and stone brick.  

- Replace some gear production with pipes.

- Insufficient coal flow through to the alternative steel production in mega mall; patched with filter inserters, but maybe it's supposed to be patched by coal in chests.

- Purple build should take a steel/stone lane (for elec furnace, but already made in mega mall for steel furnaces), a half red lane (for elec furnace). a second steel lane (for rails), and boxed prod1.
